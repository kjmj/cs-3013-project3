# cs-3013-project3

This project helped illustrate the problem of a race condition, and how to design systems that avoid it. In part1, we implemented a system that would let pirates and ninjas use the same dressing room. In part2, we simulated an intersections with cars trying to get through.

Check out the part1 and part2 directory for more information on each simulation.
