----- Question Phase 1 -----
Assume that the Minnesotan drivers follow the convention that whoever arrives
at the intersection first proceeds first. Using the language of synchronization primitives,
describe the way this intersection is controlled.
In what ways is this method suboptimal?

----- Answer Phase 1 -----
In this situation, we can observe that parallelism is not allowed. As a driver
approaches and enters an intersection, they prevent all other drivers from entering
the intersection. This occurs because they grab the mutex, and only release it after they
leave the intersection. This method does not optimize parallelism, and only allows
1 customer to be in the intersection at once. There is alot we can to do make sure that
multiple cars can be in the intersection at once, all while ensuring accidents do not occur.


----- Question Phase 2-----
The governor allows the Massachusetts drivers to return and sends the Minnesotans back home. Assume these drivers do
not follow the convention described above. In particular, Massachusetts drivers are happy to enter
an intersection, even if only the front bumper of their car will fit. In what instances can this mindset produce a deadlock? (It will
be helpful to think of this in terms of the model we are using instead of trying to visualize an actual intersection).
How can such a deadlock be prevented?

----- Answer Phase 2 -----
In this situation, massachusetts drivers are happy to enter the intersection even with cars in it.
This can lead to some complications. For example, a deadlock would occur if 4 drivers from the
N, E, S, and W directions all enter the intersection at the same time and try to take a left turn.
They all want to move, but cannot, and are thus in a deadlock. To prevent this case, we
introduced a hierarchy for locks. This ensures that circular waits are avoided. If a car
wants to make a left, and there is only one open slot, just wait until a car clears
from its quadrant, and it is good to enter the intersection. Our strategy to avoid this case,
as well as to maximize parallelism and increase traffic flow is described below.


----- How our solution meets the requirements -----
The car thread will be assigned a random approach and turn direction.
This thread will sleep for sometime randomly and then approach the intersection.
It only approaches if it is the first in the queue. Then it will enter the
intersection. Then leave the intersection. If it cannot approach or enter, it will keep
checking to see if it can enter. This ensures that only one car can be in the intersection at a time.

The intersection program prevents a deadlock by using a hierarchy for
locks. This way, we are able to prevent circular waits.
Particularly, northWest > southWest > southEast > northEast, where ">"indicates
lock hierarchy. The locks are always going to be locked or unlocked in this order. This also helps to
improve the traffic flow, while not allowing anyone to starve someone else.

The fairness is another point we want to address. I used four separate queues to
store the order for each direction. Because it is a queue, implemented using a
linked list, there is no car passing another in the queue. New car approaching will
be added at the end of queue. Four queues before approaching create some sense of
fairness. Because the car will go if they are at the end of each direction's queue.
In this sense, it is fair that if they are at the end of queue, they will try to
approach. The mutex and thread itself should provide some randomness also, because
it takes time in the while loop to try entering the intersection and leave. It is thus
hard for one direction to always get in the intersection. Additionally, this solution helps
maximize parallelism and using the intersection to its fullest potential.



----- Testing (Sample Runs) -----
We provide 3 sample runs to demonstrate how our program works, as well as a concise explanation as to why
our solution works.

----- Executive Summary of Sample Runs -----
We have 3 sample runs with 20, 50, and 100 cars. Notice that there are never two cars in the same portion of the
intersection at the same time. Additionally, cars are not deprived of a turn, and everyone makes a turn successfully.
The solution also provides fairness, and utilises the intersection to its full potential
