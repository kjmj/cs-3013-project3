----- Overview -----
This project simulates an intersection with cars trying to get through. No two cars can be in the same portion of the intersection,
and our solution aims to improve traffic flow and parallelism. The cars print messages as they approach, enter, and leave
the intersection. You can change the number of cars to run the simulation for in 'intersection.h'.

----- Usage -----
To build and run:
    make all
    ./intersection

To clean:
    make clean

----- Testing -----
Please see the file 'problem2_explanation.txt' for multiple runs and analyses with varying input to the simulator
